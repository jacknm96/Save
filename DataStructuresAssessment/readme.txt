executable files are located in the build folders in each assignment.

for double linked list and hash function, there are preset executions that will run when launched. in both cases, to exit console simply type 'e' and enter

for double linked list, it first prints out a premade list, then prints the same list but sorted

for hash function, it prints out a string, then the hash result using the given bad hash done in class, then prints out the hash result from my hash function. 
it then prints out the dehashed result, giving the original string

for the binary tree, the executable will open a raylib window and a console window. do not interact with the raylib window, but rather the console.
to insert a value into the binary tree, first type 'i', enter, and then the integer value you wish to insert.
similarly to delete a value in the tree, but first type 'd' instead of 'i'.
there is also a weird bug that the first value entered will only display an empty node in raylib. this is only for the first value; once you insert a 2nd, the tree will display correctly.
the console commands are very rudimentary, only there in order to interact with the tree. there are no catches or anything to see if you are inputting the correct commands.
to exit the application, type 'e'.
by default, the binary tree only works with integers. to test out different data types, go into main and turn the data type from int to the desired type.
note the tree only works with numerics.
