Exercise 1: Alphabetize a File
This program reads from a file and alphabetizes the list of words. It defaults to reading from
words.txt. To change the file being read from, go into the source code and change the string 
argument being passed to ReadFile to the file you wish to use (minus the '.txt.') Alternatively,
you can change the words used in words.txt - make sure you follow the same format. The first line
must be a number, then each word must appear on a new line. After sorting, it will output the
results to output.txt.
